The hyperspectral data set (dc.tif) of the Washington, DC mall area is provided with the permission of Spectral Information Technology Application Center of Virginia who was responsible for its collection.

instead of using "dc.tif" file use i used the image which is in world file because "dc.tif" was to big and my computer is not able to work on MATLAB. AND those file i used to do code are avilable on data folder.
